## Directory Structure

### `spec/` Subdirectory
The `spec/` subdirectory contains reference material to upstream specifications. These documents are canonical sources and should not be modified. Use them as authoritative references when implementing features or understanding expected behavior.

### `LIMITATIONS.md`
The [LIMITATIONS.md](LIMITATIONS.md) file documents deviations from the spec made in this application. When implementation choices diverge from the upstream specifications, those differences should be recorded there with explanations for why the deviation was necessary or chosen.
